    <h3>Theory #2: The future of everything is AI </h3>
    Another view is that the future of web development, just like a lot of other
    technologies, will heavily rely on AI. In fact, itâ€™s something we can
    already witness today. The most popular implementations nowadays include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        the jobs will stay but will be redefined completely. Designers,
        marketers, and other professionals will be able to build simpler apps,
        websites, and other digital tools visually, without writing a single
        line of code. Developers will then assist with more complex projects.
        Thus, fewer and fewer developers and designers will be needed.
      </li>
      <li>voice commands</li>
      <li>smart recommendation algorithms</li>
      <li>automated coding, testing, writing</li>
      <li>virtual reality</li>
    </ul>
    AI already has an impact on web design and development. Smart grids for
    front-end development and coding assistants are just a few examples. Every
    big company and business has implemented some sort of AI to simplify their
    work. Thus, dynamic websites powered by Artificial Intelligence(AI) can be
    the next big thing in the coming years.
