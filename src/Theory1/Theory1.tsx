    <h3>
      Theory # 1: Neither web design nor web development will exist in 10 years
    </h3>
    This is the favorite theory of online magazines. Why? Well, you don’t even
    have to come up with a clickbait title for this one. Low-code and no-code
    platforms also support this theory passionately. The idea behind it is
    simple: in 5–10 years, people won’t be writing any code themselves. The
    machines will. From here, there are a few possible scenarios:
    <ul>
      <li>
        the jobs will stay but will be redefined completely. Designers,
        marketers, and other professionals will be able to build simpler apps,
        websites, and other digital tools visually, without writing a single
        line of code. Developers will then assist with more complex projects.
        Thus, fewer and fewer developers and designers will be needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        we will see an emergence of new roles — hybrids of what were once two
        separate jobs — as the tools we use to accomplish websites become more
        efficient.
      </li>
      <li>
        the jobs will disappear completely because everything will be built
        either by using templates and ready-to-use components or
        low-code/no-code software. There will be a need only for professionals
        who are going to support these low-code platforms and components.
      </li>
    </ul>

    And What Is No-Code?
    No-code solutions also feature drag-and-drop, visual
    development. Unlike low-code, they mostly cater to business people or others
    in IT who may not know any actual programming languages but want to develop
    an application for a specific use case—often for their department.
