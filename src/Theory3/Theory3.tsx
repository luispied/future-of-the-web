    <h3>Theory #3: The future of web development is AR/VR</h3>
    Web-based virtual reality, supported by WebXR, is relatively young but
    already quite impressive. If the future of web development is AR/VR, it
    means better libraries for designing 3D objects, better web technologies and
    browsers, better VR headsets. Most likely, web developers/designers will
    also start working on designing virtual spaces (hello, Metaverse),
    360-degree views, VR games, and VR/AR/XR apps right in a browser.

    To better understand what is Web 3.0 we need to know what is Web 1.0 and
    2.0. Not to bore you, here are some simple explanations:
    <li>Web 1.0 — information only goes from the website to the user.</li>
    <li>
      Web 2.0 — information goes both ways. Users interact with the website.{" "}
    </li>
    <li>
      Web 3.0 — the great beyond. Information becomes open, decentralized,
      smart. It interacts with the user and the website or app.
    </li>
    <br />
    Web 3.0 is a decentralized trustless and permissionless network that is able
    to use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and where the data from
    its network can be accessed in many places at the same time (ex. Internet of
    Things).
