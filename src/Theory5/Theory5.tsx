    <h3>Theory #5: It’s going to stay somewhat the same</h3>
    And finally, things can just stay somewhat the same for the next decade or
    so. If yesterday’s weather is the best guide, the emphasis will be on
    building better APIs, open web, and cross-platform apps. Only 10 years ago,
    JavaScript had no chances against native mobile apps. Desktop apps and games
    were also far ahead. But by looking at what's possible in a browser today,
    it feels like we are moving in the right direction. Web development is
    constantly evolving as we discover more and more advanced tools and
    programming languages. So while things on a web front will stay more or less
    the same, they will get faster, better, and even more convenient for users.
    The world is still gradually moving online, thus there will be always a need
    for web specialists to meet the demand.
